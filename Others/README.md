To get up and running with the TeX document production system, you will need to install 
a basic TeX/LaTeX system. Some options include MiKTeX (used on my PC) or TeX Live (used on
my laptop when starting out).

With MiKTeX's integrated package manager to install missing components it makes the process much easier!
